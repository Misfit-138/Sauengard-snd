On the outskirts of town, you find a forest byway of crushed stone and lime-mortar heading toward The Black Mountain.
Drawing a deep breath, you raise your eyes to see it winding ever deeper until disappearing into thick green conifers
which finally give way to the snow-covered peak and clouds, at the top of the world.
The cold air from far above pours down the mountainside to meet you as you enter the tree cover, marking a stark and
unnerving shift of atmosphere. The paved road ends abruptly and becomes a dead-silent and pine-needle laden path,
rising ever upward. Presently, you make out an arched entranceway ahead, flanked by great stone doors of remarkable
ancient workmanship. At the top of the opening is a hewn keystone that is topped with an assortment of skulls, impaled
with various iron implements and weapons, at chaotic angles.
Pausing to look at the road behind and the world below, you pass the threshold and enter a long, echoing corridor..
