# Sauengard

> SAUENGARD is an old-school *text adventure* inspired by microcomputer
games from the 1970's and 1980's such as Infocom's Zork series,
Telengard by Daniel Lawrence, as well as Milton Bradley's 
brilliant Dark Tower tabletop electronic board game.
It is a fun and immersive RPG with relatively sophisticated 
battle system, great loot and inventory, customizable character
creation, an epic quest, and leveling.

## Development:

- Development is ongoing. Currently built on/for Windows,
with sound. GNU/Linux should work, but without sound. Anyone
willing to help with a GNU/Linux sound port is welcome. It
should be quite simple. Please contact me at:
